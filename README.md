##Purpose
A ruby library used to root out smells in your cukes. Tailored for identifying 		 critical problems as well as general improvements to your project/features/scenarios/step definitions.

Scoring is based on the number of 'smells' in a cucumber project, where smells
are potential misuses or errors. Cuke_sniffer follows a 'golf score' type system
where the lower the number, the better. 'Min' refers to the overall best score
for a particular object and the 'Max' is the overall worst object score.

Customizing Rules
----
Command line: coming soon.

Inline:
All rules are symbols in this hash and correspond to the message that is eventually displayed. Each rule has a :enabled, :phrase, :score attribute.
Some rules have a :min, :max, a custom named attribute for edge case information.

#####Turning off a rule

    CukeSniffer::RuleConfig::RULES[:numbers_in_description][:enabled] = false

#####Changing a phrase

    CukeSniffer::RuleConfig::RULES[:background_with_no_scenarios][:phrase] = "Found a bad feature, background with no scenarios"
    
#####Changing a score (custom)

    CukeSniffer::RuleConfig::RULES[:asterisk_step][:score] = 3000
    
#####Changing a score (stock)

    CukeSniffer::RuleConfig::RULES[:asterisk_step][:score] = CukeSniffer::RuleConfig::FATAL

You can also edit your source or use a gem extension to add/use your own rules! If you do let us know so we can consider putting it in the gem!

HTML Output
-----
Since there is a large amount of information that can be displayed each major section is hidden by default and can be shown/hidden by clicking on the green title bar for that section. Following that pattern, if you want to see more details of an item you can click on its title (see features, step definitions, hooks).
